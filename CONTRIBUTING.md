# Contributing

We welcome contributions, including work produced with AI assistance. The
submitter is responsible for the pull request.

Before opening a PR, make sure you can explain:

- what problem the change solves;
- why these files and APIs changed;
- how behavior changes for users, maintainers, or infrastructure;
- what you tested and what risk remains;
- whether any generated or AI-assisted code was reviewed by you.

Maintainers may close PRs that appear automated, unsupported, unrelated to an
accepted issue, or difficult to review because the author cannot explain or
iterate on the change.

Some PRs may be asked to pass VOUCHA before merge. Passing is a public
attestation that the PR was intentional and that you stand behind the change.
AI assistance in authoring a PR is allowed; AI or agent assistance answering a
VOUCHA challenge is not.
