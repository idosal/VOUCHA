VOUCHA is a free open-source project that sits in the pull request review
path as a fail-open governance layer. It complements code review, CI, tests,
branch protection, and existing maintainer workflows. It does not decide
whether a change is good. It decides whether the author has already supplied
enough trusted context, or whether the repository should ask for a short
comprehension challenge before maintainer review.

## Decision order

| Stage | What VOUCHA checks | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository policy | `.github/voucha.yml` from the merge target | PRs cannot relax their own gate by editing config on the feature branch. |
| Path-specific policy | first matching `path_rules` entry | Sensitive paths can override gates, approval, attempts, cooldown, and scope. |
| Accountability | optional PR-body acknowledgement and AI disclosure fields | Missing required policy fields fail before a quiz is created. |
| Vouch trust | optional merge-target `VOUCHED.td` lookup | Vouched authors skip the challenge, unknown authors continue, and denounced authors receive a failed check. |
| Exemptions | configurable default author trust, author rules, teams, repository roles, prior merged PRs, paths, size, issue context | Trusted or out-of-scope work gets an explanatory success check. |
| Bot verification and signals | Turnstile, browser automation flags, hidden form fields, code canaries, timing, pointer summaries | Turnstile, browser automation, and repeated server-measured sub-two-second answers can stop the gate; inconclusive signals are report-only. |
| Challenge | generated questions about intent, behavior, affected surfaces, and blast radius | A passing author attests that they understand the change. |

## What maintainers get

- A check-run summary that explains why a PR passed, was exempt, needs approval,
  or degraded to neutral.
- A policy vocabulary centered on `gates`, `exemptions`, and report-only
  `signals`.
- Accountability templates for repositories that want AI-assisted work allowed
  but explicitly owned by the submitter.
- Linked-issue triage that can reuse existing GitHub workflow instead of
  adding a VOUCHA-specific label ceremony.
- Team, role, and prior-merged-PR trust tiers for repositories that do not want
  to treat every outside contributor the same way.
- Passive canary reporting for suspicious diffs without turning a canary into
  an automatic block.
- Adaptive PR investigation for normal and large PRs, with optional Flue-backed
  investigation when configured.
- Output controls for quiet, normal, or detailed PR comments and optional
  `pr-comprehension:passed`, `pr-comprehension:failed`, and
  `pr-comprehension:flagged` labels.

## Default failure posture

VOUCHA should not become an outage-prone merge lock. Service-side failures,
model failures, malformed config fields, and unavailable signal providers
degrade narrowly and visibly. Optional trust lookups fail closed into the
normal gate, while service failures report neutral. Maintainers still see the
reason, but the product is built as review evidence rather than an infallible
gatekeeper.
