title: Issue-backed triage
description: How linked issues can exempt planned work without requiring a new maintainer-only workflow.
---

`linked_issue_match` lets maintainers reuse normal GitHub issue workflow. A PR
can be exempted when it links to trusted planned work and the implementation
matches that issue closely enough.

The intent is conservative: VOUCHA should recognize a PR that implements a
trusted issue, but it should not turn a weak issue reference into a blanket
pass.

## Link discovery

VOUCHA looks for standard closing references:

- `Fixes #123`
- `Closes owner/repo#123`
- GitHub issue URLs

By default, linked issues must be in the same repository. Cross-repo issue
references are ignored unless `require_same_repo: false` is configured.

Missing, untrusted, cross-repo, or weakly related issues fall through to the
configured gate. They do not create a failure state.

## Approved-issue bypass policy

Use this policy when maintainers want to accept implementations of work they
already approved in GitHub Issues, while asking every other contributor to
complete the VOUCHA quiz:

```yaml
require_approval: never

exemptions:
  - type: linked_issue_match
    require_same_repo: true
    require_trusted_signal: true
    min_match_score: 0.7
    max_issues: 5
    trusted_labels: [approved]
```

With this configuration:

1. A PR that closes a trusted, semantically matching issue receives an
   explanatory success check without a quiz.
2. A PR with no issue reference, an unapproved issue, or a weak issue match
   proceeds directly to the configured VOUCHA gate.
3. No additional `/voucha approve` step is required before the contributor can
   start the quiz.

The `approved` label is only an example. Reuse the repository's existing
maintainer-owned label, assignment, or maintainer-authored issue workflow.
Maintainer and collaborator issue authors are already trusted signals, as are
issues assigned to a maintainer or collaborator.

Other exemptions still apply. If the repository literally wants every
non-approved-issue PR to take the quiz, also review
`trust.default_author_associations`, `bot_policy`, `min_changed_lines`, and
`skip_paths` so those policies do not independently exempt the author or diff.

## Trusted issue signals

An issue can become trusted through existing GitHub signals:

- maintainer or collaborator issue author;
- maintainer or collaborator assignee;
- configured `trusted_labels`.

```yaml
exemptions:
  - type: linked_issue_match
    require_same_repo: true
    require_trusted_signal: true
    min_match_score: 0.7
    max_issues: 5
    trusted_labels: [accepted]
```

`require_trusted_signal: true` keeps a random issue link from becoming an
automatic exemption. Set it to `false` only when issue references are already a
trusted planning artifact in the repository.

## Semantic match

The PR title, body, and file list are compared against the requested outcome in
the linked issue. The exemption applies only when the match score meets
`min_match_score`.

This keeps the workflow practical: maintainers can keep using issues for
planning, and VOUCHA can avoid challenging implementation PRs that already
have reviewed context.

## Common operating pattern

Use issue triage for work that maintainers have already shaped:

1. Maintainer opens, labels, or assigns the issue.
2. Contributor links the issue in the PR body with a normal closing reference.
3. VOUCHA checks trust and semantic match.
4. If both pass, the PR receives an exempt success check with the reason.
5. If either is weak, the PR follows the normal challenge path.

This avoids a VOUCHA-specific ceremony. The policy reuses GitHub state that
maintainers already understand.

## Tuning advice

Keep `min_match_score` conservative. `0.7` is a reasonable default for planned
work: the PR should clearly implement the issue without requiring exact wording.

Use `trusted_labels` for labels that already mean accepted or ready to
implement. Do not add a label that means only "skip VOUCHA" unless the
repository explicitly wants that process.

Keep `max_issues` small. A PR that links many issues can become ambiguous; it
is usually better for VOUCHA to challenge the author than to infer ownership
from a broad issue list.
