title: Passive signals
description: Honeypot fields, code canaries, and review signals used to inform maintainer review.
---

Passive signals are usually evidence, not verdicts. They are collected so
maintainers can notice suspicious automation patterns without letting a brittle
signal silently block a contributor.

CLAWPTCHA keeps passive signals out of challenge scoring. They can appear in
check-run summaries, risk reports, comments, and flagged labels, but they do
not turn a correct quiz into a failure.

Two bot-verification checks are stricter: Turnstile must validate the browser
session before a quiz is generated, and a browser `webdriver` automation flag
fails the challenge if it appears during the quiz. Both failures are shown with
their reason.

## Form honeypot

`honeypot` adds an off-screen form field to the challenge pages. Broad automated
form fillers often populate hidden fields. Real authors and browser password
managers generally should not.

When the field is submitted, CLAWPTCHA records the hit in challenge telemetry
and surfaces it in review summaries. The hit does not change the quiz score.

```yaml
signals:
  - type: honeypot
    report_only: true
```

`honeypot` is enabled by default. Set `signals: []` when a repository wants no
passive honeypot collection at all.

## Code honeypot

`code_honeypot` watches for maintainer-authored literal canaries in selected
files. A common pattern is to place a do-not-add marker in internal examples,
fixtures, or documentation that low-context code generation may copy into real
source.

```yaml
signals:
  - type: code_honeypot
    report_only: true
    patterns: ["CLAWPTCHA_DO_NOT_ADD_THIS"]
    paths: ["src/**", "infra/**"]
```

File canaries are matched only in added diff lines and scoped by `paths`. The
check-run summary describes the finding without exposing the exact marker when
that would make the canary easy to game.

Code honeypots are evaluated from the PR diff before exemption decisions finish.
That means a report-only canary finding can still appear when the PR is exempt,
is a draft with neutral handling, or reuses a prior pass.

## Risk report signals

Challenge telemetry is stored as summary statistics:

- per-question timing;
- answer-change count;
- aggregate pointer distance and sample count;
- focus-loss count;
- Turnstile outcome;
- browser `webdriver` state;
- form honeypot state;
- code honeypot state.

Those summaries are only collected after the contributor accepts the challenge
terms on the start page. See [Privacy and data](/docs/privacy-data/) for the
full data boundary.

CLAWPTCHA treats two or more independent unusual signals as automation-likely
for reporting purposes. A single signal is intentionally not enough: keyboard
navigation, browser extensions, network issues, and accessibility setups can
look unusual without implying bad faith.

When a quiz passes but the risk report is automation-likely, the check title
calls that out. If `output.labels: true`, CLAWPTCHA also best-effort creates
and applies `pr-comprehension:flagged`.

## Why report-only

Passive signals can be noisy:

- bots can avoid hidden fields once they know about them;
- humans can accidentally trip canaries while moving examples;
- timing and pointer signals can fail for environmental reasons;
- most automation hints are useful for review but weak as standalone proof.

For that reason, form honeypot and code honeypot signals are forced
report-only. A config that sets `report_only: false` for those signals is
normalized back to report-only behavior.

## Practical canary design

Good canaries are narrow and uninteresting:

- unique strings that do not appear in normal code;
- scoped to paths where introducing the marker would matter;
- placed in examples, fixtures, prompts, or docs that a low-context generator
  might copy;
- rotated when they become too visible.

Avoid canaries that look like real secrets. The point is not to bait a secret
scanner or confuse contributors. The point is to give maintainers a quiet
signal that a diff may have copied from a source it did not understand.
