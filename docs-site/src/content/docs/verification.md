title: Verification checklist
description: Manual smoke tests, rollout checks, and known limitations for operating VOUCHA on a real repository.
---

Use this page after installation or after changing policy. The automated test
suite covers the code paths; these checks prove the deployed GitHub App,
Worker, Turnstile, model provider, and repository policy work together.

## Local checks

Run these before deploying or when editing the docs/site:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

For release readiness, also run:

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run
```

## First repository smoke

Use a demo repository with the GitHub App installed.

- Open a PR from a non-maintainer account. The check should be queued and the
  PR should receive a VOUCHA comment.
- If `require_approval: first_time` applies, the challenge should wait for
  `/voucha approve`.
- Comment `/voucha approve` from a write or admin user. The comment should
  update with the challenge link.
- Open the link as the PR author, accept the challenge terms, pass Turnstile,
  and answer the quiz.
- Confirm the page shows 30 seconds per question, refresh does not reset the
  timer, and no minimum wait prevents an immediate human answer.
- Confirm the check turns green, the PR comment records the attestation, and
  the check-run output includes the risk report.
- On a clean pass with `output.labels.passed` enabled, confirm the PR receives
  `VOUCHA:passed` and no longer carries `VOUCHA:failed` or a stale
  `VOUCHA:flagged` label.

## Policy scenarios

Walk each scenario that the repository intends to rely on:

- docs-only or skipped paths produce an exempt success check;
- draft PRs stay quiet when `draft_prs: ignore`;
- missing required accountability fields fail before a quiz is created;
- valid acknowledgement and AI disclosure allow the PR to continue;
- a linked trusted issue can exempt planned work;
- untrusted or weakly related issue links fall through to the gate;
- configured `github_team` or `repository_permission` exemptions work for a
  known account;
- `prior_merged_prs` exempts an author with enough merged PRs;
- configured `code_honeypot` patterns appear as maintainer-facing findings when
  introduced in added diff lines;
- a docs-only delta after a pass carries that pass forward under the default
  `rechallenge` policy;
- a meaningful delta after a pass creates a short follow-up quiz scoped only to
  commits after the passed head.

## Failure drills

VOUCHA should fail open for service-side problems and fail closed only for
repository policy requirements.

- Temporarily break the model provider or model name, then start a quiz. The
  check should become neutral rather than blocking the merge.
- Configure `context.investigator: flue` without a working Flue service. Quiz
  generation should become neutral.
- Submit a wrong quiz answer. A non-final failure should offer **Try again** in
  the app immediately by default, without requiring a return to GitHub, and the
  retry should get a fresh quiz. With `output.labels.failed` enabled, the PR
  should receive `VOUCHA:failed` and drop stale success labels.
- Start a quiz and revisit its start URL in a second tab. Both tabs should lead
  to the same active attempt, not generate another question set or consume a
  second attempt.
- Abandon an admitted quiz beyond its overall deadline. The sweep should close
  and consume that attempt. With a positive `cooldown_minutes`, later attempts
  should use increasing waits capped at eight times the base.
- Verify a production Turnstile response is rejected when its hostname,
  `action`, or signed `cData` does not match the current challenge. A rejected
  token is a hard verification failure; a Siteverify outage is neutral.
- Complete a correct quiz with two documented ambiguous interaction signals.
  The check should wait for confirmation rather than pass or fail. An author
  with an established passkey can confirm in the browser. Otherwise, a
  write-capable maintainer other than the PR author can comment
  `/voucha confirm`.
- After a clean pass, test optional passkey enrollment. Confirm cancellation or
  an unsupported browser leaves the contributor unblocked and the maintainer
  confirmation path remains available.
- Set `confirmation.webauthn: false`. Confirm the clean-pass page has no
  enrollment control, all passkey endpoints return `403`, and a paused result
  shows only the independent maintainer `/voucha confirm` path.
- Exhaust all attempts. The check should stay failed for manual maintainer
  review. Comment `/voucha retry` from a write-capable maintainer; VOUCHA
  should preserve the previous audit and start a fresh challenge on the same
  commit.
- With `enforcement.auto_close` enabled, exhaust all attempts or trigger a hard
  assistance failure. The check should stay failed and the PR should close.
- Leave an awaiting or ready challenge untouched. The scheduled sweep should
  neutralize stale setup after the configured stale window.

## What to record

For each rollout, record:

- repository and PR used for the smoke test;
- effective `.github/voucha.yml`;
- expected and observed check conclusion;
- whether a PR comment was created or updated;
- whether the author-facing quiz link worked;
- the configured label object and observed passed, failed, or flagged label
  transitions;
- any risk-report signals or neutral outcomes;
- whether the result was acceptable for branch protection.

## Known limitations

VOUCHA is an accountability and review-evidence layer, not an unbeatable
security boundary.

- An agent with browser control can potentially take the quiz on behalf of the
  author. The product records an attestation and risk report; it does not prove
  humanness.
- Pull request text and diff content are untrusted input to quiz generation. A
  hostile contributor can try prompt injection. Correct answers stay
  server-side, so this can make a quiz weaker but should not reveal an answer
  key.
- Webhook handling is asynchronous. If background work fails after GitHub
  accepts the webhook, recovery depends on GitHub redelivery, idempotent event
  handling, the scheduled sweep, and maintainer-triggered `/voucha retry` for a
  terminal challenge after the service recovers.
- PR comment lookup currently checks one page of issue comments. Very noisy PRs
  can receive a duplicate VOUCHA comment if the tracked comment is beyond
  that page.
