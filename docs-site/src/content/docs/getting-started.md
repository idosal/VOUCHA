description: A practical first rollout path for adding CLAWPTCHA to a repository.
---

Start with a narrow policy, verify the check-run behavior on a few known PRs,
then tighten path-specific rules only where maintainers actually need them.

## 1. Choose the operating model

For the managed service, install the CLAWPTCHA GitHub App and keep policy in
the repository. Maintainers control the `.github/clawptcha.yml` file and review
the resulting check runs.

For self-deploy, run the Cloudflare Worker, D1 database, GitHub App credentials,
Turnstile keys, and model provider in your own account.

```bash
npx wrangler login && npm run setup
```

The Worker can use Workers AI by default. External model providers and the
optional Flue investigator are advanced deployment choices, not prerequisites
for the first repository.

## 2. Add the first policy file

Create `.github/clawptcha.yml` on the default branch or the branch you merge
into. CLAWPTCHA reads policy from the PR's merge target, not from the PR branch.
The full default policy template is `templates/clawptcha.yml`; this abbreviated
first policy keeps the same core behavior.

```yaml
gates:
  - type: multiple_choice
    questions: 4
    pass_threshold: 3

require_approval: first_time
draft_prs: ignore

signals:
  - type: honeypot
    report_only: true

skip_paths: ["docs/**", "*.md"]
min_changed_lines: 10
output:
  comments: normal
```

This gives first-time contributors a maintainer checkpoint before the quiz,
keeps draft PRs quiet until they are ready for review, skips docs-only work,
and records the default form honeypot signal as review evidence.

Also copy or adapt `templates/contributing-policy.md` into `CONTRIBUTING.md`
and `templates/pull_request_template.md` into the repository PR template. It
tells contributors the same policy CLAWPTCHA enforces: AI assistance is
allowed, but the submitter must understand, test, explain, and support the PR.

## 3. Verify the first scenarios

Before tightening policy, open or replay a few predictable PRs:

- a docs-only PR should get an exempt success check;
- a first-time contributor PR should wait for `/clawptcha approve`;
- a normal challenged PR should produce a quiz link, pass, and then post a
  green attestation check;
- a failed quiz should enter cooldown and then offer a fresh retry;
- a new commit after a pass should keep the prior pass with the default
  `rechallenge.on_push: never`.

If the check reports neutral, treat that as a CLAWPTCHA-side availability or
generation problem, not as a verdict on the PR.

## 4. Add repository-specific rules

Once the default path is working, add policy where the repository has real
review risk:

```yaml
path_rules:
  - paths: ["src/auth/**", "migrations/**", ".github/workflows/**"]
    gates:
      - type: multiple_choice
        questions: 6
        pass_threshold: 5
    require_approval: always
    max_attempts: 2
    cooldown_minutes: 30
```

Use path rules for sensitive areas instead of making every contribution pay the
same cost.

## 5. Introduce trusted context

When maintainers already plan work in GitHub issues, add issue-backed triage.
This lets CLAWPTCHA exempt PRs that link to trusted issues and semantically
match the requested outcome.

```yaml
exemptions:
  - type: linked_issue_match
    require_same_repo: true
    require_trusted_signal: true
    min_match_score: 0.7
    trusted_labels: [accepted, ready]
```

Prefer labels and assignments your maintainers already use. Avoid adding a
CLAWPTCHA-only label ceremony unless the repository truly wants that workflow.
